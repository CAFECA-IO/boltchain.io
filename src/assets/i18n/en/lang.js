  faq: {
    title: 'FAQ',
    question1: 'What industries can apply Boltchain technology?',
    answer1: 'Boltchain is designed to be compatible with both a company’s central system and a public blockchain at the same time, allowing companies to effectively use the blockchain to build relevant applications. In a general business environment, when there is an intermediary or if an activity requires the intervention of a supervisory authority and cannot be completely decentralized, we can solve the problem of inaccurate information between users and intermediaries. Examples of such industries include copyright management of digital content and the financial industry.',
    question2: 'Why use Boltchain?',
    answer2: 'Boltchain can solve the obstacles that are currently preventing the use of blockchain in central systems, including bandwidth, privacy, and convenience. And it uses mainstream public chains to provide extremely high global consensus and permanence.',
    question3: 'What are the technical features of Boltchain?',
    answer3: 'Hybrid-chain evidence and Cross-chain Channel (C3) protocol.',
    question4: 'Why can Boltchain significantly reduce on-chain costs?',
    answer4: 'Boltchain uses an Off-chain compression technology to operate all transactions outside the main chain and generate a hash value before recording it back onto the main chain. These layers reach a consensus with the main chain to secure and increase the data to put on chain.',
    question5: 'Why Boltchain provides post audit method?',
    answer5: 'When the hash value of the booster is recorded back into the main chain, the participants is unable to be informed of the consistency of results, so we used distributed auditing techniques and easy-to-use tool to meet their audit needs.',
    question6: 'What is Boltchain different from other cross-chain & sidechain technologies?',
    answer6: 'There are three main categories of side chain technology: relay chain types, lower channel types, and hierarchical side chains.  Boltchain not only solves the problems of the first three traditional side-chain technologies, but also further provides applications such as central service interfaces and cross-chain value swap.',
